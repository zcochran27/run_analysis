    <h1>Run Boy Run (An Analysis of Runs in Behind in Soccer)</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
    Off-the-ball runs in behind are a fundamental attacking mechanism in soccer, influencing both the creation of goal-scoring opportunities and the disruption of defensive structures. This study analyzes the characteristics of such runs and their relationship to shot creation using a large-scale spatiotemporal tracking dataset provided by SkillCorner. By integrating player-tracking data with event-level annotations of off-ball runs, we reconstructed possessions, identified whether each possession led to a shot, and extracted a comprehensive set of run-level features, including spatial endpoints, run angle, speed, defensive line interactions, and positional relationships to the ball.
    </p>

    <p>
    We first established that possessions containing at least one run in behind were 14% more likely to result in a shot, confirming their attacking value. To identify which run characteristics predict shot outcomes, we conducted a series of one-variable logistic regression models, supported by distributional comparisons and correlation analysis to detect feature relevance and redundancy. Several features emerged as significant predictors of shot-producing possessions: end location of the run, distance covered, width change during the run, diagonal run angle, change in defensive line height, and proximity of the runner to the ball carrier.
    </p>

    <p>
    Analysis of shot-leading versus non-shot-leading runs revealed consistent patterns. Runs that travel longer distances, move centrally, end near the top of the penalty box, follow diagonal trajectories, create measurable defensive-line displacement, and occur closer to the player in possession all show increased likelihood of producing a shot. These findings align with tactical intuition around counterattacks, striker movement, and defensive manipulation.
    </p>

    <p>
    While the linear models used cannot fully capture the complex interdependence between features, this work provides evidence-based insights into what constitutes an effective run in behind. The results offer a foundation for future modeling using more expressive nonlinear methods and provide practical guidance for coaching, player development, and data-driven tactical analysis.
